        <p>
          A fraction is a way to represent a part of a whole. It is written as <em>a / b</em>, where:
        </p>
        <p><strong>a</strong> is the numerator (the number of parts you have)</p>
        <p><strong>b</strong> is the denominator (the total number of parts)</p>

        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <p>
          <li>1/2 means one part out of two equal parts.</li>
          <li>3/4 means three parts out of four equal parts.</li>
          <li>5/8 means five parts out of eight equal parts.</li>
        </p>

        <strong>Here are more examples:</strong>
        <p>
          <li>2/5 means two parts out of five equal parts. Imagine splitting a cake into 5 pieces, and you take 2 of them.</li>
          <li>7/10 means seven parts out of ten equal parts. If a chocolate bar is divided into 10 pieces and you eat 7, you have eaten 7/10 of it.</li>
          <li>9/12 can be simplified to 3/4. This means nine parts out of twelve equal parts, which is the same as three parts out of four.</li>
          <li>1/3 means one part out of three equal parts. Think of cutting a pizza into 3 slices, and you eat one of them.</li>
          <li>11/15 means eleven parts out of fifteen equal parts. If you have a pizza sliced into 15 slices and you eat 11, youâ€™ve eaten 11/15.</li>
        </p>

        <h3>Different Types of Fractions:</h3>
        <p>
          <li><strong>Proper Fractions:</strong> The numerator is smaller than the denominator (e.g., 2/5, 3/4).</li>
          <li><strong>Improper Fractions:</strong> The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator (e.g., 7/4, 11/8).</li>
          <li><strong>Mixed Numbers:</strong> A whole number and a proper fraction together (e.g., 1 1/2, 2 3/4).</li>
        </p>

        <p>
          Fractions are useful in everyday life â€” for example, when measuring ingredients for a recipe, dividing something into equal parts, or even calculating time.

        <strong>
          Fun Tip ðŸ’¡: Fractions can be converted into decimals and percentages. 
          For example, 1/2 is equivalent to 0.5 or 50%!
