 Welcome to Learning Fractions!

A fraction is a way to represent a part of a whole. It is written as a / b, where:

a is the numerator (the number of parts you have)

b is the denominator (the total number of parts)

Examples:

1/2 means one part out of two equal parts.

3/4 means three parts out of four equal parts.

5/8 means five parts out of eight equal parts.

Here are more examples:

2/5 means two parts out of five equal parts. Imagine splitting a cake into 5 pieces, and you take 2 of them.

7/10 means seven parts out of ten equal parts. If a chocolate bar is divided into 10 pieces and you eat 7, you have eaten 7/10 of it.

9/12 can be simplified to 3/4. This means nine parts out of twelve equal parts, which is the same as three parts out of four.

1/3 means one part out of three equal parts. Think of cutting a pizza into 3 slices, and you eat one of them.

11/15 means eleven parts out of fifteen equal parts. If you have a pizza sliced into 15 slices and you eat 11, youâ€™ve eaten 11/15.

Different Types of Fractions:

Proper Fractions: The numerator is smaller than the denominator (e.g., 2/5, 3/4).

Improper Fractions: The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator (e.g., 7/4, 11/8).

Mixed Numbers: A whole number and a proper fraction together (e.g., 1 1/2, 2 3/4).

Fractions are useful in everyday life â€” for example, when measuring ingredients for a recipe, dividing something into equal parts, or even calculating time.

Fun Tip:
Fractions can be converted into decimals and percentages. For example, 1/2 is equivalent to 0.5 or 50%!
